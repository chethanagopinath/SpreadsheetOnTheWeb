Worked on creating a single page app using ReactJS.
1. There will be a landing page that will take as input the spreadsheet name, and will also validate that the name contains alphanumeric characters, underscore, hyphen or spac alone.
2. The control flows to the spreadsheet app which consists of a single input component which consists of a cellId, formula pair that can be used to change cell formulas or display each cell's formula/value.
3. The displayed spreadsheet consists of right-mouse context menu that contains options to copy, paste and delete cell values/formulas. When right-clicked on the spreadsheet name to the top left corner of the spreadsheet, there is also a functionality to clear the spreadsheet.
