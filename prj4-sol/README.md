The web services created in the previous sub-project are used to display a rudimentary UI which allows displaying and updating spreadsheets using a browser.
- Implemented a web services client, `ss-client`, which will call the spreadsheet storage web services implemented in Project 3 sub-project. 
- These client services implement the spreadsheet storage interface, which is used to instantiate a spreadsheet. 
- Also implemented a HTTP server which will use instances of this spreadsheet to respond to web requests with suitable HTML pages.
